# üêò ethnotary 

Designed with decentralization in mind for the worldwide community. üåê

**ethnotary** helps users secure funds or treasuries for their onchain activities. We take accepted standards from ethereum to provide easy to use interfaces where users can customize smart contracts to fit their needs and manage their assests on the blockchain. We do not collect any user data. We provide our interface in a sufficiently distributed architecture that ensures robust and reliable operation gloablly on the world wide web.

As such, we suggest a one-time donation for the use of the ethnotary tools. This donation helps support the maintenance, upkeep, and continuous improvements for our community of users.

## Security

ethnotary has not been audited by a third party, a security audit is pending. ethnotary does not collect any user data or hold any user fund. Please use ethnotary at your own risk as the application is still in active development. 

## Installation

This guide will walk you through the steps required to run ethnotary on your local machine. You can also access the dApp on the web at [ethnotary.io](http://ethnotary.io).

### Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

- **Web3 Enabled Browser**: Use a browser with Web3 capabilities, such as [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) for Chrome or Firefox.
- **ethnotary Smart Contract Address** If you do not have an contract address, you can create one at [wizard page](https://ethnotary.io/wizard.html).
- **Python 3.x** (Only if running locally): [Download and install Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if it's not already installed.


### Accessing via the web @  [ethnotary.io](http://ethnotary.io)

You can access ethnotary in your web3 enabled browser by navigating to:

```http://ethnotary.io?YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS```

Replace `YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS` in the URL with your account address. If you do not have an account, you can create one online at [wizard page](http://ethnotary.io/wizard.html). Make sure your Web3-enabled browser that is connected to the appropriate network.


#### Running ethnotary locally

If you prefer to run ethnotary on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. **Clone the Repository**

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

2. Navigate to the ethnotary directory & start a local HTTP server

To run ethnotary on your local machine, you need to start a simple HTTP server. Run the following command in the terminal:

```python -m http.server 8000```

3. Open the dApp in a Web3 Enabled Browser

Once the server is running, open your Web3-enabled browser and navigate to the following URL:

```http://localhost:8000/?YOUR_ACCOUNT_ADDRESS```

Replace YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS in the URL with your account address.

4. If you do not have an account address, you can create one using the wizard page opening your web3 browser and navigating to:

http://localhost:8000/wizard.html

Make sure your Web3 enabled browser is connected to the appropriate network.



**Notes**
- Ensure your browser has Web3 integration. You can do this by installing a wallet such as MetaMask or by using a browser that natively supports Web3.
- The dApp will not function properly without connecting to a Web3 network, so double-check that your Web3 provider (MetaMask or similar) is working as expected.

**Troubleshooting**
- If you encounter any issues while running the dApp, please check the following:
- Make sure you are in the correct directory when running the Python HTTP server.
- Ensure your web browser has Web3 enabled and is connected to the correct network.
- If you encounter port-related issues, ensure that port 8000 is not in use by another application.
