Contribution Guide:

Ethnotary has 3 major ongoing development themes. Themes serve as guidelines & priorities for the ongoing development of the applications and its tools. ANyone looking to contribute to our project should familiarize themselves with these 3 themes. 

Simplicity & Optimization
1) Any measure to make our codebase smaller, light weight, and overall easier to understand are welcomed. Generally speaking these measures can be quantified as:
Reducing the size of the codebase while still allowing its regular operation.

2) Optimization of calls to third party APIs. We aim to reduce dependencies on 3rd party APIs as much as possible. 
3) Gas optimizations of smart contracts. 


User Experience
1) The application's ease of use is of great importance to us. We welcome any changes or updates that make our tools easier to use or understand. Improvements to user experience are typically expected to address one of the following design challenges:
Blockchains deal in bytecode and hexadecimals. We welcome any systems or integrations that make these types human readable.

2) Reduction of room for user error. We encourage systems that allow users to clearly understand what actions they are performing and minimize the risk of user data being compromised. 


Security
1) Ensuring users' funds and sensitive data is not compromised to malicious actors is a top priority. We look for updates that will:
Highlight potential attack vectors with recommendations to prevent or mitigate these attacks.
