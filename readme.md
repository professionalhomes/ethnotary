# üêò ethnotary üêò

ethnotary is a smart account platform. Currently built on the Ethereum network with support for various layer 2 networks like Soneium, Polygon, BNB Chain, and Base. 

This isn‚Äôt intended to be a speculative asset or token. But rather a service for users of blockchains.

These smart accounts help users secure funds or treasuries for their onchain activities. We strive to provide this utility in a sufficiently distributed architecture that allows for its robust & reliable operation on the world wide web.



# Installation
This guide will walk you through the steps required to run the decentralized application (dApp) on your local machine or access it via the hosted version at ethnotary.io.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, ensure you have the following:

-Python 3.x (if running locally): Download and Install Python if not already installed.
-Web3 Enabled Browser: Use a browser with Web3 capabilities, such as MetaMask for Chrome or Firefox.
Accessing the dApp

**Option 1: Access via ethnotary.io**
You can access the dApp directly by navigating to:


```http://ethnotary.io/index1.html?YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS```

Replace YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS in the URL with your Ethereum account address.

If you do not have an Ethereum account, you can create a new account either:

By using the wizard page on the hosted site at ethnotary.io/wizard.html

Or, by navigating to the wizard page locally (see instructions below).
Make sure your Web3-enabled browser is active and connected to the appropriate Ethereum network.

**Option 2: Running the dApp Locally**
If you prefer to run the dApp on your local machine, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git:


```git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-repo-name.git```

Replace yourusername and your-repo-name with your actual GitHub username and repository name.

2. Navigate to the Project Directory

Change directory to the root of the project folder:

```cd your-repo-name```

3. Start a Local HTTP Server

To serve the dApp files on your local machine, you need to start a simple HTTP server. Run the following command in the terminal:

```python -m http.server 8000```

This will start an HTTP server on port 8000 and serve files from the current directory.

4. Open the dApp in a Web3 Enabled Browser

Once the server is running, open your Web3-enabled browser and navigate to the following URL:

```http://localhost:8000/index1.html?YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS```

Replace YOUR_ETH_ADDRESS in the URL with your Ethereum account address.


## Create a New Account

If you do not have an Ethereum account, you can create one using the local wizard page by navigating to:


```http://localhost:8000/wizard.html```

Make sure your Web3 browser (e.g., MetaMask) is properly set up and connected to the appropriate Ethereum network.

**Notes**
- Ensure your browser has Web3 integration. You can do this by installing a wallet such as MetaMask or by using a browser that natively supports Web3.
- The dApp will not function properly without connecting to a Web3 network, so double-check that your Web3 provider (MetaMask or similar) is working as expected.

**Troubleshooting**
- If you encounter any issues while running the dApp, please check the following:
- Make sure you are in the correct directory when running the Python HTTP server.
- Ensure your web browser has Web3 enabled and is connected to the correct network.
- If you encounter port-related issues, ensure that port 8000 is not in use by another application.
