# üêò ethnotary üêò

ethnotary is a cryptographic utility tool that allows blockchain based individuals and communities to organize and conduct its operations. We accomplish this through our frontend interface that allows users the ability to read, write to, and deploy new smart contract based applications. 

These applications help users secure funds or treasuries through multisignature logic, manage commerce on blockchains through ERC 721 & 1155 standards, and help decentralized autonomous organizations facilitate its operations. 

We take accepted standards from ethereum and other blockchains communities to provide easy to use interfaces where users can organize and customize these standards to their needs and publish on chain! We strive to provide this utility in a sufficiently distributed architecture that allows for its robust & reliable operation on the world wide web.

This isn‚Äôt intended to be a speculative asset or token. But rather a service for users of cryptographic technologies.

As such, we charge a fixed one time fee for the use of the ethnotary tools. After which, the ethnotary tools are yours to keep and can be accessed by users at any time either locally on your machine or through the web. This fee covers the maintenance, upkeep, and iterative improvements for our community of users. 

More to come soon!


# Installation
To start dApp on your local machine, please run "python -m http.server 8000" within the directory. Then navigate to http://localhost:8000/index1.html?0x014AF42316A9f69a5a38A422705fE06b6B9D3d4F in your browser. Please make sure you are using a web3 enabled browser.      



# Contribution Guide:

Ethnotary has 3 major ongoing development themes. Themes serve as guidelines & priorities for the ongoing development of the applications and its tools. Anyone looking to contribute to our project should familiarize themselves with these 3 themes. 

## Simplicity & Optimization
Any measure to make our codebase smaller, light weight, and overall easier to understand are welcomed. Generally speaking these measures can be quantified as:

1) Reducing the size of the codebase while still allowing its regular operation.
2) Optimization of calls to third party APIs. We aim to reduce dependencies on 3rd party APIs as much as possible. 
3) Gas optimizations of smart contracts. 


## User Experience
The application's ease of use is of great importance to us. We welcome any changes or updates that make our tools easier to use or understand. Improvements to user experience are typically expected to address one of the following design challenges:

1) Blockchains deal in bytecode and hexadecimals. We welcome any systems or integrations that make these types human readable.
2) Reduction of room for user error. We encourage systems that allow users to clearly understand what actions they are performing and minimize the risk of user data being compromised. 


## Security
Ensuring users' funds and sensitive data is not compromised to malicious actors is a top priority. We look for updates that will:

1) Highlight potential attack vectors with recommendations to prevent or mitigate these attacks.
